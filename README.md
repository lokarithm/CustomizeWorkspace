# CustomizeWorkspace
Bash code that customizes your workspace on Linux Mint. Technically should work on any Debian based linux system. Your mileage may vary.

Note: ***This is an experimental project. If it works properly, I'll add the graduated bash code to a different folder.***.

# Usage
Run `./main.sh` to start configuration
